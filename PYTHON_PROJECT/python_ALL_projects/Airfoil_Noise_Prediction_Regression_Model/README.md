# Airfoil_Noise_Prediction_Regression_Model
Predicts sound pressure level (SPL) from airfoil data using regression models. Uses features like frequency, angle of attack, chord length, and velocity to estimate acoustic noise, helping design quieter, more efficient systems in aviation and wind energy.

🧠 What you do locally:
You installed all your libraries on Python 3.9.19

You trained your model, tested your code, everything worked smoothly ✅
```

```
💬 What you're telling Heroku:
“Hey Heroku, when you run my app, please use the same Python version I used — 3.9.19 — so nothing breaks.”

You do this by adding:

Copy
Edit
runtime.txt → python-3.9.19
```
```
⚙️ Why it matters:
Some Python versions remove or change features

Old packages may not work on newer Python versions

Pickle files (.pkl) often break if Python or scikit-learn versions are mismatched
```

"Python 3.9.19 — from this version, I am going to install libraries which are supported,"

it means:

You have chosen Python 3.9.19 as your project’s Python version.

You will install only those libraries that are compatible and work well with Python 3.9.19.

This helps avoid version conflicts or errors that happen if a library requires a different Python version.

It ensures your environment (local or deployed) is stable and predictable because both Python and library versions are compatible.
